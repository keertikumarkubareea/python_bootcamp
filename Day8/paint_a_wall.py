"""
You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.

Note:
The math.ceil (ceiling) function returns the smallest integer higher or equal to x.

For Python 3:

import math
print(math.ceil(4.2))
For Python 2:

import math
print(int(math.ceil(4.2)))
